;; The PMLc implementation should specify or retrieve modality specifications

;; The specifications are used to create and connect the modalities.
;; A ModalityConnector is assigned to each modality which monitors 
;; the receipt of impulses from PMLb for efferent modalities, and 
;; of sensory data from the SAL for afferent modalities.

;; Initially, the modality specifications will be hard-coded here
;; in the form of input values ot the create-modality function.
